    <p>I first became aware of architecture as part of my art history university curriculum, which I later specialized in the study of architecture. Through my experience and analysis of historic buildings, and in particular the medieval urban fabric of Tours, architecture appeared to me as the bearer of an artistic approach and a way to asserting a think.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The idea of making architecture, on the other hand, came about through a reflection on space and its experience. My current interests focus on how architecture conditions social groups, includes or excludes them; and how to analyze and exploit the formal elements that transform our behavior.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>The practice of architecture enables me to experiment with social issues and to respond, through artistic practice, to concrete demands, be they political or comfort-related.
