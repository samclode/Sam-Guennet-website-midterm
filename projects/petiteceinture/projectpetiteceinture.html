        </div>

            <p>The «petite ceinture», a former railroad line that encircles a large part of Paris, is already in many places a landscaped area for strolling and relaxing in a green environment. In its condition prior to intervention, this section of the petite ceinture in the 20th arrondissement is not very friendly. No access is provided, and barbed wire has been laid to prevent it. And yet, it is already a meeting place for local residents. Children play in the scaffolding, walkers venture out with their dogs, people come to graffiti, and in the evenings, raves are organised in the former station.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The aim here is to provide access that will enable everyone to enjoy the site.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To cross the five-meter height separating the street from the quay, three spaces are linked by a slope and a staircase. The absence of a low wall between the three levels formally connects them, allowing a general view.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>One entrance is located on the first level, intended for the crossroads, while the other is higher up on Rue Florian, intended for students from the nearby secondary school. As you ascend through the levels, you’ll find: a space connected to the city, with wide seating areas and a large boules pitch; another, greener space, which also contains a boules pitch and bleachers for taking a break and watching the game; and a final, freer space, like a public garden.
