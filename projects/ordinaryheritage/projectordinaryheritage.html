            <p>What should we do with single-family homes in the suburbs of our cities? The houses of the «Paris - Jardins» cooperative in Draveil have architectural qualities that deserve to be highlighted. We don’t live in the same way today as we did a century ago, when they were first built. The contemporary challenges of densification and rising property prices are forcing us to question the model of the single-family home, with parents, children and dog</p>
            <br>
            <p>The house is now home to a shared apartment for two people or couples.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The challenge on the ground floor is to reconnect with the garden. Originally, there were very few openings and the relationship with the garden was impermeable. The west wall was knocked down and a covered terrace built. Supported by large concrete posts, the structure frames views of the garden. The floor plan has been designed accordingly. Communal spaces are opened transversally, from the covered entrance to the garden. The result is large spaces that project into the flourishing environment of Paris - Jardins.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The first floor is reserved for private spaces. Each resident has his or her own bedroom, bathroom and study.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The large overhang of the terrace protects from the sun, which is particularly aggressive since this façade faces southwest. Inside, in addition to thermal renovation, the open plan design allows for significant air circulation. The roof features sarking insulation.
