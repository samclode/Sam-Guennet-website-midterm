            <p>Conservatory at Ivry-sur-Seine</p>
        </div>
        <div class="bodyarticle">
            <p>The aim is to propose a major new development for the town of Ivry-sur-Seine. A 3,000 mÂ² art centre dedicated to musical creation and dance will be built next to the Parc des Cormailles. </p>
            <br>
            <p>The ground floor is open to all. A tree-lined courtyard welcomes the public and leads them to the main hall. Individual practice rooms are open to all in order to open up artistic practice as much as possible. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The music school is located on the upper floors, around the large central courtyard. The practice rooms are designed to provide the best possible acoustics. The walls are not parallel to avoid floating echoes, and the architectural elements are separated to prevent sound transmission between the rooms. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The performance spaces offer a wide range of possible presentations, from the most formal to the most free. The large auditorium, with a capacity of 400, has a classical, frontal layout. The amplified music auditorium is designed in the style of a club, with a standing capacity of over 600. Finally, the hall is transformed into a centrally-planned stage area.
